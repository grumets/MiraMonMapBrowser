<p>In the South Moravian case study, the majority of farms belong to one of the two farm specialization categories: general cropping (P1; 28%) or permanent crops (P3; 32%). While P1 farms are typically large in terms of economic size (but many also very small, <2000€), P3 farms are more evenly distributed between small, medium and large economic size categories. Large P1 farms occur across the entire lowland part of the case study region and cover by far the largest area from all identified farm systems (78% of the region’s farmland). While similar in the number of farms, P3 farms cover much smaller area (only 3%) and are scattered across the lowland part of the region, in locations where climatic and soil conditions are favourable for maintaining vineyards and fruit plantations.</p>

<p>There are only three farms specializing in horticulture (P2) but a considerable number of farms (23%) are dedicated to grazing livestock and forage crops (P4). These are located predominantly in the eastern hilly part of the region, covering 10% of the region’s farmland, where conditions are favourable for maintaining pastures and permanent grasslands. P4 farms are typically much smaller in economic size than P1 or P3 farms, most of them being in the small or <2000 category. Finally, mixed farms (16% of all farms) that combine general cropping with grazing livestock are located at the interface between P4 farms in the highlands and P1 farms in the lowlands. Mixed farms range in economic size but large mixed farms are the second most extensive farming system in the region (8% of the region’s farmland).</p>

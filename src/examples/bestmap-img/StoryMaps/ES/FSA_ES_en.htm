<p>The Farming System Archetypes is a typology of classification of agricultural systems that assumes that they have a similar response in terms of the adoption of agri-environmental schemes and the change of agricultural policies. FSAs are defined based on the main characteristics of the farm determined by two main dimensions: firstly, the specialization of the holding and, secondly, the economic size.</p></div>

The areas dedicated to forage crops for animals and pasture are located in the Pyrenean and pre-Pyrenean areas of Catalonia. This is due to the abundant bovine livestock that exists in these areas, where lower temperatures favor the presence of cattle such as the Friesian breed (or pint of milk cow), whose characteristics do not allow it to adapt to very hot areas. 
These regions correspond to the P4L and P4M type FSAs (Fig 1).

Agricultural areas categorized as P1 (General Crops) appear in the middle of the community. This area of ​​Catalonia corresponds to a flat area, ideal for growing cereals such as wheat. The flat topography of this place allows this type of temporary plantations to develop adequately (Fig 2).

The third of the great sectors of Catalonia is the southwest area. This is cataloged as P3 mostly (permanent cultivation areas), something that is explained by the presence of wine growing areas (mostly in coastal areas) and other types of plantations such as fruit trees, a type of product that is very present in the entire community and that climatologically these areas allow their adequate development (Fig 3).

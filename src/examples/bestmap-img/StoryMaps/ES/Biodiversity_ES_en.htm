<p>Catalonia, located in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula, has an approximate area of ​​32,000 km2. Most of the land is dedicated to agiculture and therefore, a large part of the local biodiversity depends on the farmland. The intensification of land use and the homogenization of the landscape are serious threats to the good conditions of agricultural ecosystems and to the biodiversity they support.</p>  

<p>In BESTMAP, we investigated whether Agri-environmental schemes (including organic farming) and Ecological Focus Areas (EFA) are effective tools to conserve farmland biodiversity. Using ensemble species distribution models and spatially-explicit field-level information on crops grown, farming practice (organic/conventional), and applied AES/EFA from the Integrated Administration and Control System, we investigated the relationships between five groups of measures (buffer areas, cover crops, extensive grassland management, fallow land and organic farming) and the relative occurrence of 38 farmland bird species in the region of Catalonia.</p></div>

<p>For example, the most suitable habitat of the Red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio) is  mainly located at the northern part of Catalonia. It is a summer nester which is regularly distributed in humid areas of Catalonia and in alpine and subalpine environments of the Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees. It is a scarce migrant bird species in the rest of the Catalan region (Foto: Ramon Prat Espelt).</p>

<p>Subsequently, it has been evaluated how the suitability of the breeding habitat would change if Agri-environmental schemes and EFA zones were completely eliminated.</p>

<p>The results show how the suitability habitat would be slightly reduced.</p>

<p>Along these lines, the results indicate that Agri-environmental measures can be effective conservation tools tools if higher adoption levels are reached. The heterogeneity of responses across species and spatial scales indicates that a mix of different measures, applied widely across the agricultural landscape, would likely maximise the benefits for biodiversity.  This can only be achieved if the measures in the future CAP will be cooperatively designed in a regionally-targeted way, to improve their attractiveness for farmers and widen their uptake.</p>

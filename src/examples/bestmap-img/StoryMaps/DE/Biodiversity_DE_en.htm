<h1>Estimating the effects of agri-environmental schemes on habitat suitability for farmland birds in the Mulde River Basin, Germany</h1>

<p>The Mulde River Basin is located in the western part of the federal state of Saxony, Germany, and covers an area of 5,814 km2. More than half of this area is covered by agricultural land like cropland, mowing pastures and meadows. A large share of the local biodiversity thus relies on farmland, and land-use intensification and landscape homogenisation are serious threats to the good conditions of agroecosystem and to the biodiversity that they support.</p>

<p>In BESTMAP, we investigated whether agri-environmental schemes (AES), ecological focus areas (EFA) and organic farming are effective conservation tools for farmland biodiversity. Using species distribution models and spatially-explicit field-level information on crops grown, farming practice (organic/conventional), and applied AES/EFA, we investigated the effects of five groups of measures (buffer areas, cover crops, extensive grassland management, fallow land and organic farming) on the occurrences of 15 farmland bird species in the Mulde River Basin.

For each bird species, we modelled the effect of each measure, as well as the estimated habitat suitability across the region, based on the 2019 land-use data.</p>

<p>We further assessed how breeding habitat suitability would change if the agri-environment measures (AEM, used as umbrella term for AES, EFA and organic farming) were completely removed.

 And if their adoption by farmers increased to meet conservation-informed targets.</p>

<p> The boxplot on the right visualizes the differences in the distribution of habitat suitability values in the three maps.</p>

<p>We found that agri-environment measures can be effective conservation tools if higher adoption levels are reached. The heterogeneity of responses across species and spatial scales indicates that a mix of different measures, applied widely across the agricultural landscape, would likely maximise the benefits for biodiversity. This can only be achieved if the measures in the future CAP will be cooperatively designed in a regionally-targeted way, to improve their attractiveness for farmers and widen their uptake.</p>

        <p>The main objective of this model is to estimate how the adoption of Agro-Environmental Schemes (AES) affects soil carbon sequestration on field level/within landscapes. As a result, the model output consists of map layers of soil organic carbon per field/parcel, under the current land-use patterns and AES implementation and under alternative-now scenarios. The user can select one of the 2 different scenarios from the dropdown list "Scenario". The 2 possible scenarios are:</p>

            <ul style= "list-style-type: disc;">
                <li><b>no AES:</b> Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) value expressed in t/ha at farm-level when AES are not adopted.</li>
                <li><b>with AES:</b> Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) value expressed in t/ha at farm-level when AES are adopted.</li>
                </ul>


        <p>In the Humber (UK) case study, the percentage change (%) using Soil Organic Carbon at farm-level [t/farm] between with and without AES has been calculated. In order to visualise these results, the user has to select "perc diff" from the "Scenario" dropdown list and select "Diff." (please see below). Values are positive as Soil Organic Carbon increases on land employing AES.</p>

        <p>The main objective of the model is to estimate how the adoption of Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) affects yield and production area of selected agricultural crops as well as economic output at the field and farm level.The model output results consist of the following layers:

            <ul style= "list-style-type: disc;">
                <li><b style= "color: #000099;">Crop production:</b> modeled production of the field parcel in dt.</li> 
                <li><b style= "color: #000099;">Yield:</b> modeled yield of the field parcel in dt/ha.</li>
                <li><b style= "color: #000099;">Standard output coeficient:</b> modeled standard output of the field parcel in €/ha.</li>
            </ul>

        <p> Each layer consists of 3 different pieces of information which the user can select from the three available dropdown lists:</p>
            
            <ul style= "list-style-type: '- ';">
                <li><b>Year:</b> year for which the model has been calculated;</li> 
                <li><b>Scenario:</b> either with AES or no AES, indicating the scenario with current Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) adoption, or the one without AES.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>In the Humber (UK) case study, the percentage difference (%) between standard output under with and without AES has been calculated. In order to visualise these results, the user has to select "perc diff" from the "Scenario" dropdown list and select "Diff." (please see below).</p>

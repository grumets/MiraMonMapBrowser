        <p>The main objective of the Agent Based Model is to reproduce the adoption patterns of Agri-Environment Schemes affects based on its current adoption. Simulations of different scenarios are run based on the level of advisory of farmers, the amount of payments and the lenght of the contracts. This results should only be used to showcase the potential of the ABM but are not suitable for drawing any conclusions. The four scenarios defined are:

                         <li><b style= "color: #000099;"></b> <br><br>
 
                        <ul style= "list-style-type: '- ';">
                            <li><b>Status Quo:</b> Reference scenario. Refers to a scenario with three schemes (buffer areas, cover crops, maintaining grassland) with contract length = 5 years, no advisory support, medium level of bureaucracy and current payment levels;</li> 
                            <li><b>Advisory:</b> Scenario with all farmers having access to advisory and assumption that availability of advisory will reduce willingness to accept by 5% compared to status quo, remaining contract attributes equal to Status Quo;</li>
                            <li><b>High payments:</b> Scenario with payments for all schemes 10% higher than payment in Status Quo, remaining contract attributes equal to Status Quo;</li>
                            <li><b>Short contracts:</b> Scenario with all contracts having a duration of 1 year and assumption that one year contracts reduce willingness to accept by 20% compared to Status Quo, remaining contract attributes equal to Status Quo.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                </li>
